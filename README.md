This code is a MATLAB script that performs several data processing and analysis tasks related to atmospheric ozone concentrations. Here is a brief overview of the different parts of the code:

The first section of the code reads in a netCDF file containing ozone concentration data for a specific date and time. It loads the latitude and longitude coordinates, as well as various radius values and other parameters that will be used later in the script.

The second section of the code performs some initial checks on the data in the netCDF file, making sure that all of the data is numeric and that there are no NaN values. If any of these checks fail, the script will stop executing.

The third section of the code calls a function called Sequential_Function with different values of a parameter called SizeLoop. This function is responsible for processing the ozone concentration data in a sequential (i.e., non-parallel) manner, using a sliding window approach. The output of this function is a time value that represents the amount of time it took to process the data using the given value of SizeLoop.

The fourth section of the code calls a function called Parallel_Function with different values of two parameters: Num2ProcessList and poolSize. This function is similar to Sequential_Function, but it processes the data in a parallel manner using a specified number of worker processes (poolSize). The output of this function is also a time value.

The final section of the code combines the output from the previous sections and creates a graph that compares the processing time for the different values of SizeLoop and Num2ProcessList with the different values of poolSize. The graph is saved to a file called "MainFunction.png".

Overall, this script demonstrates how to load and process large amounts of atmospheric data using both sequential and parallel processing techniques in MATLAB.
